# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
## About
The SONAR technique has revolutionized the discovery of rocks and minerals, providing insights that were once elusive. By leveraging specific parameters, this technique enables the detection of surface targets or obstacles like rocks or mines. Machine learning has emerged as a cornerstone of modern technology, permeating industries from banking to consumer goods, showcasing remarkable advancements in predictive analytics. Such predictions are made possible through machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, which we have implemented in Google Colab.

## DataSet
The dataset, sourced from the UCI Repository, encompasses 61 features that delineate between Rocks and Mines, comprising a total of 209 samples. This dataset serves the dual purpose of training and testing. The last column in the dataset serves as a crucial indicator, distinguishing whether an object is a mine or a rock, thereby facilitating accurate predictions. You can find the dataset included in this repository.

## Model
The chosen model for this project is Logistic Regression. Logistic regression is a statistical model that employs a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. This function, often represented as a sigmoid or logit function, transforms the input values into a range between 0 and 1, forming an "S" shaped curve. By utilizing this sigmoid function, logistic regression mitigates the impact of outliers and ensures that the output remains within the 0 to 1 range. Given its binary classification nature, logistic regression is well-suited for predicting whether an object is a mine or a rock based on sonar data.
